# Whitney Young

Whitney Young is the co-founder and lead developer at [FadingRed](http://www.fadingred.com/), a Mac and iOS software shop located in Chicago. He has been developing on the Mac platform for over 8 years, beginning with his first application, Senuti, a popular music recovery tool. After a short stint in the options trading world, Whitney left to pursue his longtime passion — creating simple, intuitive, and useful applications. These days he spends most of his time working on Koku, a simple and elegant personal finance app. He is also responsible for creating a computer security course at his alma mater, where he was able to hone his teaching skills. Today, Whitney leads his five person development team through the intricacies of Cocoa development while pursuing hobbies like cooking and biking along Lake Michigan.

### Painless Localization

In this session we will dive into the details of a new method for localizing applications. Localization in Cocoa has always been a bit of a chore, and as developers, we need this to change so we can focus our energy on writing code and producing great apps. Say goodbye to the days of fiddling with command line tools — this session will tackle simplifying the process of making applications localizable both for developers and translators. In the end, your apps will be painless to localize, and you will be able to ship to more people in their native languages.
