### Painless Localization

In this session we will dive into the details of a new method for localizing applications. Localization in Cocoa has always been a bit of a chore, and as developers, we need this to change so we can focus our energy on writing code and producing great apps. Say goodbye to the days of fiddling with command line tools â€” this session will tackle simplifying the process of making applications localizable both for developers and translators. In the end, your apps will be painless to localize, and you will be able to ship to more people in their native languages.
